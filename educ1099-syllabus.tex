\part{The EDUC1099 Contract}
\begin{fullwidth}

\textit{\textbf{Your first job} is to work at developing an academic relationship with me as your professor} just as you should work to develop a relationship with all of your professors. This job for you extends to \emph{all} of your classes; you will find that putting the effort into building an academic relationship with your professors pays off. Putting effort into building an academic relationship with your professor will make your other two jobs flow much more smoothly. I am (and all of your professors are) here to help you succeed. In order to help me support you, you need to help me know what you need. If you have a question, if you don't understand something, if you are having trouble getting to class, if you need a different explanation of something, \emph{talk to me}. Sometimes this means coming to my Student Drop-In Hours or scheduling an appointment with me outside of class. I work very hard to get to know my students in class, but I get to know them even better (and I can provide more targeted support) when my students talk with me outside of class.

\textit{\textbf{Your second job} is to get to know and learn how to use all of the course materials.} I will provide you with information, models, and scaffolding in the syllabus and other companion documents. These companion documents include \texttt{Reference Sheets}, \texttt{Project Packages}, and \texttt{Model Assignments}. Success in this class involves organizing and understanding these sources of information; we will go over the syllabus in depth during the first class, and I am happy to meet with you to discuss the course and its requirements further.

\textit{\textbf{Your third job} is to consider the long-term returns you will gain from putting effort into the work of this course.} When you are in college, your primary work responsibilities are to your coursework. You are in the Teacher Education Program and the effort you put into your coursework will pay off in terms of becoming a better prepared and more successful teacher. It is hard to find a balance between these long-term payoffs and short term needs (such as paying for rent, clothing, or entertainment and fun activities). You may also be more responsible for your time and attention than you ever have been before, so it is easy to slip into a pattern of missing classes. I am more than happy to help you find the right balance and to connect you with people and resources than can provide further support.

\textit{\textbf{My jobs as your professor}} include designing an engaging, relevant, productive course, facilitating class activities that I believe will be effective in the learning process, assessing your work in a fair, timely manner, and creating a safe, supportive space in which everyone can be who she or he is and freely contribute to the class. I am here to support you as you succeed in this course and in the Teacher Education Program, but I can only do so with your help.

\end{fullwidth}

\subsection{Course Throughlines}
\marginnote{Using vocabulary of the profession is important and will help you communicate with your professors and colleagues in a precise and professional manner. We will therefore be using the ideas and language of the Teaching for Understanding (TfU) framework. According to TfU, \textit{throughlines} \enquote{describe the most important understandings that students should develop during an entire course.} Throughlines are the big ideas that we will be exploring and developing understandings around over the semester.}

	\end{center}
\end{marginfigure}

\section{A Commitment to Universal Learning}
\newthought{I am committed to the principle of universal learning.} This means that our classroom, our virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to universal learning.

Any student with particular needs should contact the coordinator of Disability Services at the start of the semester. Services are available to any student, full or part-time, who has a need because of a [documented] disability.\marginnote{The coordinator of Disability Services can be reached at 304.367.4686 or 800.641.5678 Ext. 8.} It is the student's responsibility to register for services with the coordinator of students with disabilities and to provide any necessary documentation to verify a disability or the need for accommodations.  You and I can work out the details of any accommodations for this course.

\section{Improve Your Chances for Success by Coming to Class Every Day}
\newthought{Being present is important to success in this class.}\footnote{Research has found that just showing up to class is a better way to tell if you will do well in your college classes than anything else, including how you might have done in high school (Crede, Roch, and Kieszczynka, 2010).} This class is very collaborative and you will often be working in teams: your teammates depend on you. Attendance will be taken at every class, both as a way to help me learn your names and as a way to help you stay on track with attendance.

I also understand that life happens and sometimes you might need to miss class. \footnote{\textit{Some acceptable reasons to miss class} include family emergencies, car troubles break down, icy or snowy roads, or illness. \textit{Some not acceptable reasons to miss class} include oversleeping, conflict with outside jobs, or the \enquote{I don't feel like going to class} excuse.} Keep an open line of communications with me about your absences from this class. \textbf{If you need to miss class, please notify me directly by email}. Although I would prefer to be notified ahead of time of your absence, if you have an excuse for your absence you have 24 hours after class to notify me. I will notice patterns of absences\textemdash{}unexcused \emph{and} excused\textemdash{}and I will call you on it because I want to do everything I can to help you succeed.

\subsection{Building Trust: \enquote{Ooops!} Days}
You might forget me to send me an email, so \textbf{each teacher candidate in EDUC1099 receives two "Ooops!" days.} Each unexcused absence beyond your two "Ooops!" days will result in 50 points taken off your final grade for the course.\marginnote{If you earned an B in the course but had two unexcused absences beyond your two "Ooops!" days, you will receive a C for your final grade.} \emph{If you need to be excused from class for an extended period of time} for a particular reason, you must speak to me directly outside of class\textemdash{}such as during my drop-in hours, or if you can't come at those times, schedule an appointment with me\textemdash{}so that we can work out a way for you to participate in the structure and activities of the course. I will be posting your attendance status on TaskStream each month.

\newthought{The most important thing is to keep an open line of communications open with me:} I am here to help you succeed. I recognize that students are required to miss class for many different reasons. The important thing to remember is to keep an open line of communications with me so your grade is not adversely affected.


\section{Stay Current by Keeping In Touch Outside of Class}

\newthought{Communications between me and you outside of class will occur over \underline{email}.} \marginnote{If you wish to be notified by text every time I send an email to the class, please send a text to 81010. If you are in the 9:00am class, send the message \texttt{@edu2201-9}. If you are in the 12:00pm class, send the message \texttt{@edu2201-12}.}Please do not send me a message through Blackboard. Please make sure to check your Fairmont State email on a regular basis (at least 4-5 times per week). If you do not have a smart phone, a computer or internet access at home or in your dorm room, make it a regular practice to go to the library and check your email there.

\section{Learn More by Submitting Assignments and Making Good Use of Feedback}
\newthought{It is important to submit assignments on time} as a professional courtesy to yourself, your professor, and your classmates. All assignments are due in TaskStream before \textit{Pumpkin Hour}\footnote{\textit{Pumpkin Hour} is 11:59pm on the day the assignment is due.}. It is best not to wait until the Very Last Minute to submit assignments on \texttt{TaskStream}, as the submission process requires several steps.

I completely understand that life happens and emergencies, illnesses, and other situations come up when you least want them to.\marginnote{The \textit{Things Happen Buffer} gives you a little wriggle-room when it comes to handling the things that come up in life. Make sure to send me an email within \emph{24 hours} after the due date if something comes up. The sooner you contact me the better.} If you are involved in an emergency, illness, or situation, please inform me via email as soon as possible, preferably before the due date, and we can discuss an extension. I also understand that things may happen on the date an assignment is due, so every student in EDUC2201 has a \textit{Things Happen Buffer}.

\part{Performances of Understanding}

\begin{marginfigure}%

	\end{center}
\end{marginfigure}

\newthought{Performances of Understanding are a way for you to demonstrate what you understand while also building your understanding.} The \textit{Performances of Understanding}\footnote{Performances of Understanding are a concept from the Teaching for Understanding framework.} are what you produce in each of the 4 units of the course. Each of these Performances are designed to not only help me see what you understand, but also to help you deepen your knowledge and develop your skills around the use of technology in teaching and learning. You will receive a \textsf{Project Package} at the beginning of each unit which will include more specifics about what I expect from you, including a copy of the rubric that I will be using to evaluate your work. In addition to the Culminating Performances themselves, you will engage in Check-In Performances to help you get ready for the Culminating Performances.

\section{Unit 1:  Introducing Social and Emotional Approaches to Teaching and Learning}

In this unit, we will be exploring a framework for social and emotional approaches to teaching and learning. We will see how this framework intersects with the real lives of teachers and learners and the work in which they engage together. As a way to help you make these connections, you will be keeping a two-day journal in which you document when aspects of this framework intersect with your own experiences as a learner. You will then write a comprehensive, analytical, and rigorous reflection on what happened, how these experiences intersected with the framework, and how you now see things differently.

\medskip\noindent\textit{$\mapsto$~Your 48-Hour Social-Emotional Journal is worth \textbf{20 points}.}

\section{Unit 2: The Impact of Stories on Teaching and Learning}

When examining the social and emotional aspects of teaching and learning, it is important to recognize the stories we tell about ourselves, the stories we construct around others, and the stories that others tell about us. The story of the "redneck" is one that is intertwined with the cultural history of Appalachia, and is mostly not flattering. We will learn about the history of this phrase, learn about its significance, and work to "re-write" its meaning through creative artifacts. This re-writing is important to help students who may live out the stories written for them instead write the stories and live the lives they prefer.

\medskip\noindent\textit{$\mapsto$~Your Redneck Project is worth \textbf{20 points}.}

\section{Unit 3: Your Work to Model Social and Emotional Approaches to Teaching and Learning}

Modeling is one of the most powerful tools for teaching. It is therefore important to model social and emotional practices in your own teaching and learning lives as an educator. Each person in the class will select a social-emotional practice and conduct research into what it is, what purpose it serves, how it works, and what the potential outcomes are. You will create a short poster presentation for a Social-Emotional Practices Conference. You will be able to engage classmates in conversation about these practices.

\medskip\noindent\textit{$\mapsto$~Your presentation in the Social-Emotional Practices Conference is worth \textbf{20 points}.}

\subsection{Unit 4: Social and Emotional Teaching and Learning in the Wide World}

One of the most important jobs of an educator is to facilitate an environment to promote learning, and planning this environment is a necessary part of this process. As such, as your last performance, you will be planning an activity that incorporates principles and practices of social-emotional learning and teaching. This plan is a condensed version of the lesson plan format you will be expected to write later in your career as a teacher education candidate. I hope that you will continue

\medskip\noindent\textit{$\mapsto$~Your Social-Emotional Activity Plan is worth \textbf{20 points}.}

\section{Cross-Unit Considerations}

Blah

\medskip\noindent\textit{$\mapsto$~These combined considerations are worth \textbf{20 points}.}

\section{Course Point Breakdown}

\marginnote{90-100 points is an A, 80-89 points is a B, 70-79 points is a C, 65-69 is a D, 64 or less is an F.}Keep in mind that \emph{\textbf{you earn your grade}}. I do not "give" you a grade. As a teacher, I place a great deal of emphasis on becoming aware of learning processes and progress. \emph{This is a practice that is important to bring to your own students,} so I want to give you a head start.

\section{Fairmont State School of Education Conceptual Framework}
The mission of the Fairmont State University School of Education (FSU SoE) is to prepare reflective and responsive educators who possess the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to help all students learn. The FSU SoE mission is integrated across the curriculum, field experiences, clinical practice, and assessments of candidates. The conceptual framework (CF) provides the structure and guiding principles that are necessary to accomplish this mission. The five West Virginia Professional Teaching Standards (WVPTS) and their respective functions undergird the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that candidates must possess in order to facilitate learning for all students. Diversity and technology are included in the CF representing themes that are integrated throughout the unit's programs. Demonstrated competencies in the standards/functions empower candidates to function as reflective and responsive educators. The CF is based on research about effective teaching and learning best practices that apply to teacher candidates at the initial level as well as accomplished teachers at the advanced level. The CF and the WVPTS also are central guiding elements of the FSU Professional Development School (PDS) Partnership that provides a critical structure and context for teacher education and educator professional development.

\subsection{Academic Integrity}

Fairmont State values highly the integrity of its student scholars. All students and faculty members are urged to share in the responsibility for removing every situation which might permit or encourage academic dishonesty. Cheating in any form, including plagiarism, must be considered a matter of the gravest concern. Cheating is defined here as: the obtaining of information during an examination; the unauthorized use of books, notes, or other sources of information prior to or during an examination; the removal of faculty examination materials; the alteration of documents or records; or actions identifiable as occurring with the intent to defraud or use under false pretense. Plagiarism is defined here as: the submission of the ideas, words (written or oral), or artistic productions of another, falsely represented as one's original effort or without giving due credit. Students and faculty should examine proper citation forms to avoid inadvertent plagiarism.

\subsection{Disability Services}

Disability services are available to any student, full or part-time, who has a need because of a documented disability. It is the student's responsibility to register for disability services and to provide any necessary documentation to verify a disability or the need for accommodations. Students must provide their professors with a copy of their academic accommodation letter each semester in order to receive accommodations. Faculty, students, and the Office of Disability Services must cooperate to ensure the most effective provision of accommodations for each class.

The Office of Disability Services is located in suite 316 of the Turley Student Services Center 333-3661. For additional information, please visit the Fairmont State University Office of Disability Services webpage at www.fairmontstate.edu/access or call (304) 333-3661.
