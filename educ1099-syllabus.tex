\newthought{Performances of Understanding are a way for you to demonstrate what you understand while also building your understanding.} The \textit{Performances of Understanding}\footnote{Performances of Understanding are a concept from the Teaching for Understanding framework.} are what you produce in each of the 4 units of the course. Each of these Performances are designed to not only help me see what you understand, but also to help you deepen your knowledge and develop your skills around the use of technology in teaching and learning. You will receive a \textsf{Project Package} at the beginning of each unit which will include more specifics about what I expect from you, including a copy of the rubric that I will be using to evaluate your work. In addition to the Culminating Performances themselves, you will engage in Check-In Performances to help you get ready for the Culminating Performances.

\section{Unit 1:  Introducing Social and Emotional Approaches to Teaching and Learning}

In this unit, we will be exploring a framework for social and emotional approaches to teaching and learning. We will see how this framework intersects with the real lives of teachers and learners and the work in which they engage together. As a way to help you make these connections, you will be keeping a two-day journal in which you document when aspects of this framework intersect with your own experiences as a learner. You will then write a comprehensive, analytical, and rigorous reflection on what happened, how these experiences intersected with the framework, and how you now see things differently.

\medskip\noindent\textit{$\mapsto$ Your 48-Hour Social-Emotional Journal is worth \textbf{20 points}.}

\section{Unit 2: The Impact of Stories on Teaching and Learning}

When examining the social and emotional aspects of teaching and learning, it is important to recognize the stories we tell about ourselves, the stories we construct around others, and the stories that others tell about us. The story of the "redneck" is one that is intertwined with the cultural history of Appalachia, and is mostly not flattering. We will learn about the history of this phrase, learn about its significance, and work to "re-write" its meaning through creative artifacts. This re-writing is important to help students who may live out the stories written for them instead write the stories and live the lives they prefer.

\medskip\noindent\textit{$\mapsto$ Your Redneck Project is worth \textbf{20 points}.}

\section{Unit 3: Your Work to Model Social and Emotional Approaches to Teaching and Learning}

%Modeling is one of the most powerful tools for teaching. It is therefore important to model social and emotional practices in your own teaching and learning lives as an educator. Each person in the class will select a social-emotional practice and conduct research into what it is, what purpose it serves, how it works, and what the potential outcomes are. You will create a short poster presentation for a Social-Emotional Practices Conference. You will be able to engage classmates in conversation about these practices.
Modeling is one of the most powerful tools for teaching. It is therefore important to model social and emotional practices in your own teaching and learning lives as an educator. In this unit, we will be focusing on two particular families of practice: \textit{restorative justice practices} and \textit{contemplative practices}. The culminating performance for this unit will be to complete a personal "contemplative practices tree" (\url{http://www.contemplativemind.org/practices/tree}) based on your own learning and life experiences. We will be sharing  these "trees" as part of a contemplative practices discussion day.

\medskip\noindent\textit{$\mapsto$ Your Contemplative Practices Tree is worth \textbf{20 points}.}

\subsection{Unit 4: Social and Emotional Teaching and Learning in the Wide World}

One of the most important jobs of an educator is to facilitate an environment to promote learning, and planning this environment is a necessary part of this process. As such, as your last performance, you will be planning an activity that incorporates principles and practices of social-emotional learning and teaching. This plan is a condensed version of the lesson plan format you will be expected to write later in your career as a teacher education candidate. I hope that you will continue to incorporate social-emotional learning and teaching principles and practices as you continue on your path to becoming an educator.

\medskip\noindent\textit{$\mapsto$ Your Social-Emotional Activity Plan is worth \textbf{20 points}.}

\section{Cross-Unit Considerations}

There are a number of ways that I look at your participation and your work over the course of the 8 week semester. I look for sustained effort and growth in the course through your Check-In Performances, your participation in class, and your trajectory over the course of the entire 8 weeks. These combined considerations will be scored /textit{holistically}, that is, without a rubric. You can guarantee success in these areas by following the suggested course practices for participation and whole-heartedly completing the Check-In Performances.

\medskip\noindent\textit{$\mapsto$ These combined considerations are worth \textbf{20 points}.}

\section{Course Point Breakdown}

\marginnote{90-100 points is an A, 80-89 points is a B, 70-79 points is a C, 65-69 is a D, 64 or less is an F.}Keep in mind that \emph{\textbf{you earn your grade}}. I do not "give" you a grade. As a teacher, I place a great deal of emphasis on becoming aware of learning processes and progress. \emph{This is a practice that is important to bring to your own students,} so I want to give you a head start.
