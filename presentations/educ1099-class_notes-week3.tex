From the *Connecticut Post* May 8, 2012:

Last year, black and Hispanic students received nearly 75 percent of the 42,913 external suspensions given to Connecticut students, even though they made up just 32 percent of student enrollment, according to an analysis of student discipline data by Connecticut Voices for Children.

A black student in Connecticut is nearly eight times more likely to receive an out-of-school suspension than a white student, the group found.

...

But compared with other states, Connecticut ranks high in terms of minority suspension rates. During the 2004-05 school year, Connecticut had the ninth-highest rate of suspensions among black students and the third-highest rate of suspensions among Hispanic students, according to a Chicago Tribune analysis of disciplinary data collected by the U.S. Department of Education. But the state had the lowest proportion of white students who received suspensions in the nation.
